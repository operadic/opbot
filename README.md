# opbot -- an operadic bot

NOTE: This is very much a work-in-progress.

## Goal
The initial goals are:
1. Create a bot that cohesively operates over different protocols. Features might be initially similar to/inspired by fiatjaf's excellent `@lntxbot` Telegram bot: https://git.alhur.es/fiatjaf/lntxbot
2. Provide implementations of the bot via other methods such as over email (e.g. in an email-chain rather than a telegram chat room), or possibly over the lightning network itself!


## Todo
2. Experiment with trees in an operadic algebraic sense.

## Done
0. Write a really simple but incomplete readme file.
1. Setup a simple scala build situation for us to explore from.
